            <p class="text-justify"><b>Technocrats India College Finder (TICF)</b> is a Social Entrepreneurship venture founded by experienced professionals from College of Engineering, Guindy.</p><p class="text-justify">We strongly believe that every parent irrespective of their monetary status is inquisitive to provide good and quality education to their children.  They aspire that their heirs graduating out of a reputed institution will rewrite the destiny of the future generations.  The students’ educational aspirations should not be shattered. Only quality education will change individual’s life game than any other means, not money.</p><p class="text-justify">When we were students ourselves, there was no one to guide us in our career decisions, or to tell us about the various reputed and renowned educational options available after 10+2.  We can understand the situation you’re in, as we’ve been through the same some years back. </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Over the years, when young friends and relatives came to us for advice, we realized that this confusion about career choices was the norm rather than the exception. Today, a student’s career depends entirely on the choices he/she makes. Making a crucial career decision has always been a challenging one, and it has become even tougher with the privatization of college education and hence this venture. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">We have set out on a mission to create awareness among the student and parent communities so that their choices are made armed with relevant information. We want to make parents realize that their notions of a successful career path have long since changed! We want them to realize that the world has become a much better place to study, work and grow in the last few years.</p><p class="text-justify">And nothing makes us happier than to see students guided by us making sound decisions and finding opportunities which they never thought existed, before they met us or attended one of our seminars.</p>
